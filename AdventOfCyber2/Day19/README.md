### General steps
By following the steps shown we can eventually find a message to Santa containing his password `Be good for goodness sake!`. After we get this we can simply try out all of the different username possibilities such as `santa`, `Santa`, `admin`, `Admin` and find out that `Santa` is the correct one and we can then get the flag `THM{EVERYONE_GETS_PRESENTS}`.
