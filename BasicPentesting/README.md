# Basic Pentesting

## Associated files
* `nmap_scan.log` - Output of `nmap` scan
* `enum4linux.log` - Output of `enum4linux` run
* `linpeas.log` - Output of `linpeas` run
* `kay_rsa` - Kay's rsa private key
* `forjohn.txt` - Form of private key that John can understand
* `john.out` - Output of John

## Steps

IP: `10.10.140.254`

### Services exposed

Running Ubuntu
Using `nmap` we find the following open ports:
Port 22 (ssh)
Port 80 (apache)
Port 139 (samba)
Port 445 (samba)
Port 8009 (apache)
Port 8080 (apache)

### Hidden directory

DirBuster shows `/development` as a directory on the server. It exists with 2 different text files which seem to be chat communication between two people.

### Username and Password

enum4linux shows two users in Samba. They are `jan` and `kay`

Using hydra with `rockyou.txt` we get a password of `armando` for user `jan`

### Final password

Using `linpeas` we can see that the user `kay` has a private ssh key as shown in `kay_rsa`. We can use John the Ripper to crack it and show that the password is `beeswax`. Before we can actually use the rsa private key to ssh into kay's account we have to `chmod 600` as otherwise ssh won't accept it. Once we login we can simply `cat` `pass.bak` and see that it is `heresareallystrongpasswordthatfollowsthepasswordpolicy$$`.
